3. Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations. The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?
Note: For answer write the options in order separated with comma and space eg: a, b, d 
a. 5 4 3 1 2 0 9 8 7 6
b. 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
c. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
d. 1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 0
e. 1 5 0 2 3 4 6 7 8 9

Answer: d, e
